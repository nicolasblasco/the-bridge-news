Welcome to my weekly projects for the 'Become a Software Developer' RR's course. 

## Description 

### Week 03: 

The objective was to create the cover of an online newspaper (main page) using FlexBox as the main tool for creating an adaptable design following the Mobile First concept.

### Week 05: 

The objective was to add a subscription page to the online newspaper developed in week 03, maintaining its style with a responsive design and validating all the fields and buttons with the events "blur" and "focus". 

### Week 06: 

The objective was to extend the online newspaper of week 05 so that when pressing the "send" button, the data loaded in the form is sent to a web server through an HTTP request using JavaScript. 

#### In this repo, you'll find: 

* An HTML index file with the structure of main page of the online newspaper.
* An HTML sub-page file with the structure of the subscription page of the online newspaper.
* A style folder with 3 files:
  * 'normalize.css' that normalizes all the default styles of the page. 
  * 'style.css' that contains all the styles of the layout for the index.html & sub-page.html.
  * 'media-queries.css' that has all the media queries for the desktop version of both pages.
* An 'images' folder that contains all of the images used in index.html.
* A js folder that contains the 'app.js' file with all of the validation functions for the form's inputs.
